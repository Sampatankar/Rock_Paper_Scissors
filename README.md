# rock_paper_scissors
This repo will contain a basic program to test out new programming languages

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a basic game in which a player presenting a 'rock' in a fisted hand beats a player presenting a pair of scissors (due to them being blunted by rock), and are themselves beaten by a player presenting their outstretched palm as 'paper' (with paper wrapping a rock).
A player presenting scissors with two fingers outstretched and splayed (like the blades of scissors) beats a player presenting as paper, and loses to a player presenting as 'rock'.
Finally, a player presenting as paper beats a player presenting as rock, and loses to a player presenting as scissors.

In real life, this game requires players to present their choices at the end of a count, so as not to allow cheating by sight, and there is usually a mental count to understand who 'wins'.  (' ' because who really wins in these competitions?!)

The aim of this repo is to recapitulate this game in code in multiple coding languages as I learn them.

In Python, the game will require as a loose list:
- Loops
- If/Else statements
- Conditionals
- Data structures and objects
- Functions and possibly Classes - OOP

Any future alternative language versions will be a great way to compare and contrast the basic use of these languages to build something - the next steps beyond "Hello World".
